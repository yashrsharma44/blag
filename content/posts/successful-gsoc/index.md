# What I intend to cover?

This blog is a second part to this. I intend to cover key takeaways from the Google Summer of Code, so if you are selected as a GSoC student, read ahead!

## Leveraging the opportunity

Google Summer of Code is quite a valuable opportunity to develop your skills for Software Engineering and OSS. Use this opportunity wisely and judiciously, to get the best out of this program..

Wisely, because you are getting an opportunity to work on a project which has the potential to be used by millions of people. Imagine the joy and responsibility you would have, while developing a feature for Numpy and Matplotlib.

Judiciously, because your mentors are an invaluable asset for you over the next few months. You should try to solve your issues which are easily google-able, while you should save time for high level discussions and complex bugs. Time is a limited asset, so make sure you save time as and when you can, and allow yourself with some backup of time, in case a feature development takes more time than expected. Similar thing happened with me as well, and since I had saved some time, I was able to cover up for the lost time.

### Blogging and communicating with your mentor

Blogging and communication is the key to GSoC. Having good communication setup and weekly meetings are imperative to keep the mentors updated with your work.

Clear communication and asking for clarifications is important, helps you in understanding the expectations and approach which your mentor might have for your project. Your mentor knows the possible hurdles that you might not encounter, so having clear ideas and clarification helps you in enlisting and keeping the issues at bay.

Blogging helps you to document out the progress you have had for the week. It is not possible(nor it is suggested!) to keep an eye for every work that you do, so make sure you blog your progress and what kind of concrete progress you have achieved for the week. It also helps you and your mentor to assess the progress of your work, so changes with the timeline and end goals can be adjusted.

### PR Reviews an opportunity for learning

Pull requests are an important aspect of GSoC. You can have the best code written for the project, but if you haven't passed the PR Reviews, chances are that your patch isn't suitable to be merged.

PR Reviews might sound a bit intimidating(and it is for a certain extent), so make sure you break up your project into multiple parts, and push your PR as early as possible for review. It is natural to have [15-20](https://medium.com/@yashrsharma44/pull-requests-merged-in-for-gsoc19-ndcube-95a9fd15c8b6)(don't quote me on this, can vary as you agree with your mentor) PRs, helps you in managing your logistics and getting ahead with the PR reviews.

The communications can get ahead for a 100 messages, so the key is to keep the changes small and decoupled. This helps in getting more faster reviews, and the changes associated with it is gradual, rather than pushing a 1000+ line PR, which is quite clunky and tougher to get this merged.

### Tests and Docs are equally important!

Software Engineering follows the mantra -

> Code, Test and Docs

Documentation can be written when the feature is ready, but tests should be written gradually as you develop a feature. Test Driven Development is something, you can have a look, but I mostly found to write the code and then test it up later.

### Evals are scary, but make sure both of you agree on a milestone

Google Summer of Code has two evaluations as of 2020, Mid Term Evaluations and End Term Evaluations. The project is assessed with the kind of work done, and how much progress we have had. Mentors write out some suggestions and remarks about the work done uptil now.

It is imperative to understand and clarify the suggestions that has been made by the mentor during Mid Term Evaluations. It can happen that the mentor and the student might not be on the same page about the progress, so having a 1:1 talk with them is really crucial.

Having an objective goal for each evaluations is really important, as it helps out in mapping out the expectations as time progresses. [In my project](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/wiki/GSoC-2019-Yash-Sharma), I wrote up clear cut features that I intend to achieve before the evals, so being explicit in the metrics you choose to measure the progress of your project is helpful.

## Journey after Google Summer of Code

The journey after GSoC is quite variable, as you want to lead up to. You can use the learnings that you gathered during the summer, and keep working on the project/community in your free time. As mentioned before, OSS is a voluntary experience, and you can work on your free time if you wish.

Many people choose the opportunity to work with the community, while some wish to experiment with other groups. Feel free to utilise the learning and apply it into a field of interest.
